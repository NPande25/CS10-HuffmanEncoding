## CS10 Problem Set 3
### Huffman Encoding
The CS10 Problem Set 3 uses a binary tree to perform Huffman encoding, a process that compresses files by building character trees and translating characters into 0s and 1s. Using this process, we compress files of over 560,000 words in an efficient manner.
